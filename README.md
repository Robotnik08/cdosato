# CDosato

CDosato is a work in progress bytecode interpreter for the [DOSATO language](https://github.com/Robotnik08/Dosato)<br>
The first version I made was a simple tree walker, but I wanted to make it faster and more efficient, so I decided to make a bytecode interpreter.

## How to use

To use the interpreter, you need to compile the source code and run the executable

```bash
$ cd src
$ make
```

Theres also going to be new language features that the old implementation didn't have, so consider Cdosato the new standard for the DOSATO language.
